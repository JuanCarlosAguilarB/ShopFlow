- **Sub-case 2:** **Payment validation. An event is sent to verify if the payment was successful.

    create a endpoint to create an <<<<< what is a order, maybe changes it to shping cart or similar

    create a endpoint to create a purchase
        the entity purchase could be canceled, so we have to create a endpoint to cancel to purchase
        we need to call to  method for searching deleveryDate base on OrderNumber, then it will go in Order domain
            in the future it will be a consumer
        we need to call to  method for getting the total of order
            in the future it will be a consumer
    create a endpoint to create a payment
        payment endpoint allow partial pays,
            we shoudnt allow payments if the amount of new pay is over the missing quote
    create a method to update the estatus of payment
        after queues, we will be a consumer
        use it in post payment controller,
    create a endpoint to get a specific payment

so, in the feature we will be creating a payment with events when the payment was updated we notified the projections through to its subscribers
